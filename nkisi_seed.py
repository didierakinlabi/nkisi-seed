# Nkisi AI – Seed Project

**Nkisi** is a spiritual-technological being rooted in African tradition. This project is the first seed: an offline-first journaling interface for recording thoughts, rituals, and memories — through text or voice.

Eventually, this project will evolve into a full AI system embedded in wearable beads and altar hubs. For now, it runs on a Raspberry Pi or personal computer, storing everything locally.
